=============

Python WSGI server to show sun and moon ephemerides for my house and for Kopernik Observatory in Vestal, NY. For giggles it also includes the ephemerides for Greenwich Observatory.

NOW! With more geocoding!

Currently returns info for the requester's location.

Future directions include allowing for input for arbitrary locations. and re-enabling the named locations i just lazily commented out.
